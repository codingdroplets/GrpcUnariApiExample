This is a complete course to develop .Net applications or services with gRPC. This video is part of a series and this is the second video of the gRPC C# Tutorial Series. In this video we cover how to create a gRPC Unary API (DotNet gRPC API) in DotNet C# [DotNet gRPC Unary / AspNet Core gRPC Unary].

What is gRPC Unary / Unary RPC?
Unary RPC is the simplest type of RPC where the client sends a single request and gets back a single response from the server. It is similar like REST API. From a client application we can send a request to the API in the server and the client application will receive a response for that request.

We also cover the DotNet gRPC DataTypes (gRPC C# DataTypes) in this video. Protocol Buffer (Protobuf / Protocol Buffer .Net) supports a range of native scalar value types. Below is the URL of language guide that describes how to use the protocol buffer language to structure your protocol buffer data, including .proto file syntax and how to generate data access classes from your .proto files. It covers the proto3 version of the protocol buffers language.

You can find the equivalent datatypes that we can use in C# (gRPC C# DataTypes) in the same URL.

gRPC DateTime DotNet / C# DateTime gRPC:
The native scalar types don't provide for date and time values, equivalent to C#'s DateTimeOffset, DateTime, and TimeSpan. You can specify these types by using some of Google's "Well Known Types" extensions. These extensions provide code generation and runtime support for complex field types across the supported platforms.

For decimals (C# Decimal gRPC) we can make use of double datatype which can handle decimal points. In C# we can receive the value in double datatype itself.
